# Embedded Systems Learning Roadmap

This repository documents my structured learning path from
physics to embedded systems, focusing on bare-metal C,
microcontroller architecture, and hardware interaction.

## Hardware

- ATmega328P (Arduino / Elegoo Uno R3)
- ESP32 (planned)

## Toolchain

- PlatformIO
- avr-gcc
- VS Code
- Git

## Roadmap

- Phase 0: Foundations
- Phase 1: MCU Peripherals
- Phase 2: Communication
- Phase 3: RTOS Fundamentals
- Phase 4: Physics-driven Embedded Applications
